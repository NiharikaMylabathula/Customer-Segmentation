# Customer-Segmentation
It is important for the companies to identify potential customers in the market by mining the customer data to gain profits.
One of the efficient way to identify the different customer characteristics is by applying clustering analysis on the customer data. 
This would segment the customers and hence help the companies to come up with various marketing strategies accordingly. In my project, I used unsupervised Machine learning algorithm: k-means clustering , to group the customers. I used the data of a Ecommerce site, which contains the product description purchased and other purchase details. I used NLTK to extract keywords from the Product Description and used this to segment customers according to the sentiment.
